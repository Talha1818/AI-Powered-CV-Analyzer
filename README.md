# AI-Powered CV Analyzer

## Overview

This application streamlines the resume screening process by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Users can upload multiple resumes along with a job description, and the tool intelligently analyzes each CV for relevance, skills, education, and experience. It scores and ranks candidates based on their match with the provided job role, highlighting strengths and potential gaps. Key resume information—such as education background, professional experience, technical skills, and contact details—is extracted and presented in a structured, easy-to-read format. Ideal for recruiters, hiring managers, and HR professionals, this tool accelerates candidate evaluation with speed, accuracy, and insight.
